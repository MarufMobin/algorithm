Pseudocode of BFS 
=================

input -> Connected Diracted Graph And two Source 
output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversal Order there are two soruce in bfs 

BFS( graph, source1, source2 ):
    -Initiate an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"
    -mark visited[source1] = 1 and q.push( source1 ) 
    -mark visited[source2] = 1 and q.push( source2 )
    - while the queue is not empty:
        - head = q.front()
        - print the node " head "
        - for all adjacent_node of "head" :
            -if visited[ adjacent_node ] == 0:
                - visited[ adjacent_node ] = 1 and q.push( adjacent_node )
