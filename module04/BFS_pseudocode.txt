Pseudocode of BFS
==================

input -> Connected Graph and a source 
output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversel order 

BFS( graph, source ):

- Initiate an array called "visited" and an empty queue "q"
- mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push( source )
- while the queue is not empty:
    - head = q.front()
    - q.pop()
    - print the node "head"
    - for all adjacent nodes of "head" :
        - if visited[ adjacent_node ] == 0:
            - visited[ adjacent_node ] = 1 and q.push( adjacent_node )
